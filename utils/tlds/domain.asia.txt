DotAsia WHOIS LEGAL STATEMENT AND TERMS & CONDITIONS: The WHOIS service offered    
by DotAsia and the access to the records in the DotAsia WHOIS database are provided
for information purposes only. It allows persons to check whether a specific       
domain name is still available or not and to obtain information related to         
the registration records of existing domain names. DotAsia cannot, under any       
circumstances, be held liable in case the stored information would prove to        
be wrong, incomplete, or not accurate in any sense.  By submitting a query         
you agree not to use the information made available to: allow, enable or           
otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited, commercial advertising or       
other solicitations whether via email or otherwise; target advertising in any      
possible way; or to cause nuisance in any possible way to the registrants by       
sending (whether by automated, electronic processes capable of enabling high       
volumes or other possible means) messages to them.  Without prejudice to the       
above, it is explicitly forbidden to extract, copy and/or use or re-utilise        
in any form and by any means (electronically or not) the whole or a                
quantitatively or qualitatively substantial part of the contents of the WHOIS      
database without prior and explicit permission by DotAsia, nor in any attempt      
hereof, or to apply automated, electronic processes to DotAsia (or its systems).   
You agree that any reproduction and/or transmission of data for commercial         
purposes will always be considered as the extraction of a substantial part of      
the content of the WHOIS database. By submitting the query you agree to abide      
by this policy and accept that DotAsia can take measures to limit the use of its   
WHOIS services in order to protect the privacy of its registrants or the           
integrity of the database.
